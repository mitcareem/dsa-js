/*

In programming, shadowing occurs when a variable declared in a certain scope 
(e.g. a local variable) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope
 (e.g. a global variable). When this happens, 
 the outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable.

In JavaScript, variables can be shadowed in both the global and function scope. 
Global variables can be shadowed by function-scoped variables, 
and function-scoped variables can be shadowed by block-scoped variables declared 
with the let or const keyword.
