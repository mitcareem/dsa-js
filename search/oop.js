/*
--A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.

organize--plan       
organizing --planing  ---writing algo for their operations
organized--planned

--Organize--function that follows after planning means operations
or algorithms that we want to apply on the data

Algorithms is used to apply operations on data inside the data structure


--A data type tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer 
intends to use the data.

A data type is also called data structure*********


--When we store data we attach the data type on compile time or
runtime(attached by the interpreter itself)

structure ----a pattern
model----logical frame
schema----structure
documentation-----a solution template


OOP is a guideline for the programmer to program in an efficient and more 
managed way.

OOP principles leads to less error in the code, increase collaboration 
among the developers and ease of maintenance.



primitive data type----type of data e.g. int char these are compiler define data
type compiler already know that and their operations like addition for int, etc
user define data type---- book etc for user define data we have define 
their operations also e.g edit book title for book

Combination of data structure(use define data type) and their operations are
 known as ADT.

Data structure is all about creating ADT.

Worst case time complexity: it explains the maximum amount of 
time an algorithm requires to consider all input values.

the longest running time performed by an algorithm given any input of size n.
